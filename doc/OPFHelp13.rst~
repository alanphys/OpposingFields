Using Compensators
==================

The Opposing Fields program caters for compensators in the beam. As there are
a number of way of using compensators it is important to understand how the
Opposing Fields program implements them.




A compensator is a mass of material placed in the beam contoured so as to
provide a homogeneous dose distribution in the tumour volume. The compensator
is place as close to the head of the accelerator as possible to reduce
electron contamination of the photon beam. A wide variety of material may be
used to construct the compensator, among them lead, brass, aluminium,
polystyrene and other tissue equivalent plastics. The thickness of the
compensator is specified in terms of its tissue equivalent thickness along
the central beam axis because of the variation in attenuation between the
different materials. The tissue equivalent thickness is the amount of tissue
that the compensator is intended to replace or fill in.




When planning a compensator most books recommend that the SSD be taken from
the highest point on the patient in the field. While this is quite easy to do
when using bolus to fill in any irregularities in practice it is quite
difficult to do using compensators. Normally the highest point on the patient
is not on the central axis of the beam. This makes patient positioning more
difficult. Also patients are normally positioned using the distance indicator
on the central axis.




A related problem is that a compensator plan quite often originates from a
prescription requiring opposing fields place isocentrically. For these
reasons the Opposing Fields program always takes the SSD as the distance from
the source to the patients skin on the *central* beam axis no matter if
compensators are used or not.




The compensator depth is the tissue equivalent thickness of the compensator
on the central axis of the beam. This depth is subtracted internally in the
program from the given SSD and added to the treatment depth so that the
effective SSD is to the highest point of the patient.




To prevent confusion compensators may only be used on single beams. Selecting
the compensator field will cause the 'Treatment Fields' to default to single.
This will in turn inactivate the 'Prescription Type' and 'Patient diameter'
fields. If other values have been selected various warnings will be generated
before the defaults are set.
