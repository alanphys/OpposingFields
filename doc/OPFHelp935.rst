Presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The presentation may either be anterior/posterior or lateral. This field
affects whether the table factor is enabled or not. In the lateral position,
no table factor is used, so if you choose lateral the table factor field will
be blanked out. Again you may select the options by using the mouse, the
first letter of each option, or the up and down arrows on the keyboard. The
presentation field is disabled if the 'Single' option in 'Treatment field' is
selected.
