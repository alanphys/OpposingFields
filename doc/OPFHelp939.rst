Patient Diameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a numeric value between 0 and 40 cm. Depending on whether you have
chosen 'Single' or 'Opposing' in the 'Treatment fields' the 'Patient
Diameter' field may not be available. If you have chosen single fields, the
patient diameter will be blanked out and you will be taken automatically onto
the treatment depth field. If you chose opposing fields, then you will be
able to enter the patient diameter. The patient diameter is the full cross-
section of the patient that you are treating through.
