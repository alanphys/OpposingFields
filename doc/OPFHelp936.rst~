Compensator
~~~~~~~~~~~

Check this field if you want to use compensators in the beam. Make sure you
are familiar with the way the Opposing Fields program handles compensators
before checking this option. Selecting this field causes the 'Compensator
depth' field to be enabled. The 'Treatment fields' is disabled and set to the
default option of 'Single Field' as a compensator can only be used with a
single field. Selecting the 'Single' option causes the 'Prescription type' to
be disabled and set to 'Tumour dose' as described for the 'Treatment fields'.
