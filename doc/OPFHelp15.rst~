Technical Assistance
====================

If you need help using the program speak to your local physicist or the 
installer of the software, or contact the authors at the address below:

There are, of course, no bugs in the software. However, it may happen that
the software does not behave in a manner you expect or generates a plan that
you think is wrong. If so, we would like to know about it. Likewise, if you
feel OPF should be doing something that it isn't, please tell us.




The authors can be contacted on `alanc@oncology-sa.co.za`_.
