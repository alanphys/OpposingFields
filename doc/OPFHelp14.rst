Errors and Trouble Shooting
===========================

A number of errors may occur during operation of the program. If you
encounter one of these, don't panic; it is probably part of the built-in
checking system of the program. The errors are normally displayed in a
message box and you need to close the message box before continuing. Some
errors will not allow you to continue and will shut the program down.
