Normalisation Factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a general adjustment factor for any beam weighting, or modifiers such
as trays that may be used in the beam.
The number should be between zero (0) and one (1). It is a selection field. However,
you may also type the factor into this field. Commonly used normalisation factors
should already be entered into the program and by using the mouse or the
<down> and <up> arrow keys you should be able to select the appropriate
factor. The factor changes according to the photon energy that has been
chosen. Make sure that the correct energy is chosen before you choose the
normalisation factor. If you are not using normalisation, then make certain that the
factor is set to one.
