Quality assurance on parallel opposing beam treatments
------------------------------------------------------


Isocentric treatments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For parallel opposing beams the dose to the isocentre **ID** in Gy is divided
equally between the beams giving:

.. math::
   :label: eq7

   MU = \cfrac{ID \cdot 100}{2 \cdot TMR(d,r_d) \cdot S 
   \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{SAD} \right)^2}

for each beam.





Variable SSD treatments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A similar equation holds for variable SSD treatments:

.. math::
   :label: eq8

   MU = \cfrac{TD \cdot 100}{2 \cdot TMR(d,r_d) \cdot S 
   \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{STD} \right)^2}

where:

- STD is the source treatment distance (STD = SSD + d)
- TD is the tumour dose in Gy
- d is the treatment depth





Fixed SSD treatments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For parallel opposing fields the tumour dose **TD** in Gy is divided equally
between the two beams giving:

.. math::
   :label: eq9

   MU = \cfrac{TD \cdot 100}{2 \cdot\cfrac{\%DD_{d}}{100} \cdot S}





Dose at maximum build-up prescriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For parallel opposing beams the situation is a little more complex.
Fortunately the dose at maximum build-up prescription is not normally used
for parallel opposing beams. The dose at maximum buildup, Equation 5, from
the previous section must
be modified to take into account the contribution from the opposing beam
giving:

.. math::
   :label: eq10

   MU = \cfrac{MD \cdot 100}{S \cdot \left[ \left( \cfrac {SCD}{SSD + d_{max}} \right)^2
   + TMR(d,r_{d_{max}}) \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{SSD + d} \right)^2 \right]}

where **d** = patient diameter - dmax. It is recommend that this equation be used
for isocentric, variable SSD and fixed SSD treatments.




For the sake of simplicity no tray, table or compensator factors have been
included in the equations given above. When a factor is used, divide through
by the appropriate factor.
