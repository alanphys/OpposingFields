Moving between Fields
---------------------

You can either press the <TAB> key to move you from one field to the next, or
you can select each field by clicking on it with the mouse. If the field
already contains data, you can select that data by double clicking that
field. The data will then appear highlighted in blue and any typing will now
will erase all the data. The easier method is to use the <TAB> key. This
automatically highlights data in the field, and then you can either overwrite
it or retain the data.




To move between fields click on the next field with the mouse cursor or press
the <TAB> key. Data can only be entered into a field when it is displayed
in white. When the field is displayed as a dark grey colour it is disabled or
greyed and you will not be able to access the field. When the colour of the
field changes from grey to white it is enabled and you can now enter data
into it.




We are now ready to discuss the meaning of each field.
