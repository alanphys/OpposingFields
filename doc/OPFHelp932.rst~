Treatment technique
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is also a selection field. You may select between three types of
treatment; isocentric treatment, fixed SSD or variable SSD. Isocentric
treatment is the conventional treatment for a Source Axis Distance (SAD) of
one hundred centimetres (SAD = 100cm). Normally the tumour is placed at the
isocentre. The fixed SSD treatment sets the Source Surface Distance (SSD) to
one hundred centimetres (SSD = 100 cm). The variable SSD treatment allows you
to specify the SSD. Again you may select the different options either by
pressing the first letter of the option, or by using the mouse, or by using
the <up> and <down> arrow keys. You will notice that according to the options
you select; the patient diameter, treatment depth, and SSD fields will be
greyed or enabled according to the options you chose. For the isocentric and
fixed SSD treatment, you will only be able to enter in the patient diameter.
However, for the variable SSD treatment you will be able to enter the patient
diameter and the SSD.
