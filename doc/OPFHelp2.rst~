Introduction
============

The Opposing Fields program allows the easy calculation of simple
radiotherapy treatment plans. Despite its name, it cannot only do opposing
parallel fields, but can also calculate plans for single fields as well. For
each type of field it can do isocentric treatment, fixed SSD treatment (SSD =
100 cm), and also variable SSD treatments. The Opposing Fields program owes
its simplicity to the fact that it uses central axis point calculations in
contrast to more complicated three-dimensional treatment planners, which
calculate a matrix of dose points. This places some limitations on the use of
the Opposing Fields program, but it is not meant to replace the more
expensive three-dimensional treatment planners but instead to serve as
supplement or as a check against these more complex programs. Opposing Fields
should not be used where there is a high degree of tissue inhomogeneity,
uneven surfaces or radiosensitive structures. The Opposing Fields program in
effect assumes that the patient is a uniform homogeneous tissue equivalent
rectangle.




This manual assumes that you are familiar with using Microsoft Windows. If
you are not then please consult the Windows  Manual, or work through the on-
line tour which you will find in the 'Help' option on the 'Start' menu. While
a thorough knowledge of Windows is not needed to use the Opposing Fields
program, it will certainly be an advantage.
