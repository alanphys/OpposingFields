Opening an existing plan
------------------------

There are two ways of opening an existing plan, either by selecting 'File',
'Open' on the menu bar, or by clicking on the 'Open patient' speed button |Open| 
. This will cause the 'Open File' dialogue box to be displayed. See Error:
Reference source not found below. The dialogue box contains a list of
available files that you can select from. Select your file either by clicking
on it and then clicking on 'OK' or pressing <Enter> or by double-clicking the
file name. The dialogue box will close and the fields in the data entry
screen will contain the data from the file. You can now either use this data
as is or you can change it and create a new plan from this previously
existing data. If you have certain plans that are commonly used, you may want
to create template files containing the parameters that you use often, which
you can open and edit according to your needs.
