Uninstalling previous versions
==============================

It is no longer necessary to uninstall previous versions of OPF before 
installing a new version. The installation utility will backup existing data 
files and install new files. However, to be safe please save your own copy of 
your data files. If, for any reason, you still want to uninstall the program 
please follow the instructions below:

Features' and close the 'Control Panel'
