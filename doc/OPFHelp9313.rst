Table factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The table factor is the attenuation factor for the table, if any. This factor
should be between zero (0) and one (1). If no factor is being used make sure the
factor is one. It is a selection field so you should be able to select your
commonly used table factors. The field is disabled if the 'Lateral' option
for the 'Presentation' field was selected, or if the 'Single' option for the
'Treatment fields' was selected. Treatment is not normally performed through
the table in these instances.
