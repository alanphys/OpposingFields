Printing a plan
---------------

To print a plan you must be in the Results window. You cannot print a plan
from the Data Entry window. If you are in the Data Entry window, press the
Calculate button |Calc|
to calculate the plan, and the Results window will appear. The Results window
has a menu bar and a speed bar with two different options, 'Print' and
'Exit'. Click either on 'Print' on the menu bar or on the 'Print' speed
button |Print|
to print a plan. The Print dialogue box, illustrated in Error: Reference
source not found, will appear. Make sure the printer is ready and then either
click on 'OK' or press <Enter> to print. If you wish to cancel printing,
press 'Cancel' or <Esc> and you will return to the Results window.
