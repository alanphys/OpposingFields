Field Size
~~~~~~~~~~

'Field size' is a compulsory numeric field that must be entered. The field
size must be between 3 cm and 40 cm. Any value outside this will result in an
error dialogue box appearing, and you will not be allowed to continue until
you have entered in a correct value. Enter in the Y or length value, and then
the breadth or X value.
