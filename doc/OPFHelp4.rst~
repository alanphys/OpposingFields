System Requirements
===================

The Opposing Fields program can run on any machine that can run Windows XP or
higher. Thus, the program can be run with 512 MB of RAM. The program
needs approximately 5 MB of disk space to install. For ease of use we
recommend that you do not use a system smaller than a Pentium 6 1 GHz with
1 GB of RAM. A 15" monitor or larger is not essential but will make viewing
easier. Opposing Fields is best viewed at a resolution of 1024x768, but can
be viewed at resolutions down to 600x680. To store patient files we recommend
that you have at least 100 MB of disk space free. Versions for Linux and Windows
64 bit are available.
