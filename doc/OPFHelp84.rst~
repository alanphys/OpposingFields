Fields
------

A field is an area where you enter data. There are two types of fields; edit
boxes and selection boxes. An edit box allows you to type in data such as the
name of the patient.





Edit Boxes
~~~~~~~~~~

To enter data into an edit box click on the white area of the edit box with
the mouse. A thin vertical line will appear in the white area of the edit
box. This line is called the cursor and shows where any characters will
appear when you type. If the edit box already contains data which you want to
over write or change you can either press the backspace or delete keys to
erase the data or double click the characters with the mouse so that they are
highlighted in blue. You can also press <TAB> until the interior of the edit
box is highlighted in blue. Anything that you type now will replace the
highlighted characters.





Selection Boxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A selection field allows you to select an item from a list. They can be
distinguished by the small down pointing arrowhead |Down|
on the right-hand side of the field. The list can be accessed by either
clicking on the arrowhead with the mouse cursor, or by pressing the down
arrow on the cursor keypad. If you already know what the options are you can
also select them by pressing the first letter of the item. Some selection
fields allow you enter data or to select it from a list. These are known as
combo-boxes.
