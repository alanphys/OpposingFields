Quality assurance on single beam treatments
-------------------------------------------


Isocentric treatments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Treatments that are not carried out at a SSD of 100 cm are best calculated
using TMR's, as percentage depth dose tables are not usually available for
other SSD's. For a *single* field the relation between monitor units and dose
to the isocentre is as follows:

.. math::
   :label: eq1

   MU = \cfrac{ID \cdot 100}{TMR(d,r_d) \cdot S 
   \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{SAD} \right)^2}

where:

- MU are the monitor units
- ID is the isocentre dose in Gy
- TMR(d,rd) is the tissue maximum ratio at depth d and field size r at depth d
- S is the output factor
- SCD is the source calibration distance, usually 100 + dmax cm.
- SAD is the source axis distance, usually 100 cm.




For the sake of simplicity no tray, table or compensator factors have been
included in the equation given above. When a factor is used, divide through
by the appropriate factor.



Variable SSD treatments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For variable SSD treatment equation :eq:`eq1` can be
extended to:

.. math::
   :label: eq2

   MU = \cfrac{TD \cdot 100}{TMR(d,r_d) \cdot S 
   \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{STD} \right)^2}

where: 

- STD is the source treatment distance (STD = SSD + d)
- TD is the tumour dose in Gy
- d is the treatment depth




Fixed SSD treatments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While fixed SSD (SSD = 100cm) treatments can certainly be checked using the
methods outlined above the medical physicist may find it easier to use
percentage depth doses (**%DD**). This is a more suitable quantity for calculations
involving SSD techniques. The monitor units MU necessary to deliver a tumour
dose **TD** in Gy at a depth **d** for a field size **r** is:

.. math::
   :label: eq3

   MU = \cfrac{TD \cdot 100}{{\cfrac{\%DD_{d}}{100}} \cdot S 
   \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{SSD + d_{max}} \right)^2}

When the SSD = 100 cm and SSD + dmax = SCD then equation :eq:`eq3` simplifies to:

.. math::
   :label: eq4

   MU = \cfrac{TD \cdot 100}{\cfrac{\%DD_{d}}{100} \cdot S}




Dose at maximum build-up prescriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally the dose at maximum build-up prescription is not used for isocentric
treatments, particularly for single beams. However, should such a situation
occur the isocentric technique may be adapted as follows:




The accelerator is calibrated to give 1 MU/cGy at maximum build-up for a
10x10 field at the SCD, i.e. TMR(dmax,10) = 1.0. For any other field size and
SSD equation :eq:`eq2` becomes:

.. math::
   :label: eq5

   MU = \cfrac{MD \cdot 100}{S \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{SSD + d_{max}} \right)^2}

where **MD** is the dose at maximum build-up in Gy for a *single* beam.




When the SSD is fixed at 100 cm the situation is even simpler. Equation
:eq:`eq5` becomes:

.. math::
   :label: eq6

   MU = \cfrac{MD \cdot 100}{S}
