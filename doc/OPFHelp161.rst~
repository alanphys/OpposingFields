Quality Assurance Procedures
----------------------------

A number of quality assurance checks should be carried out on the program and
plans generated by it. These will usually be carried out during the normal
site quality assurance and are as follows:




-   Each plan generated must be checked. The procedures for checking the
    plans are given later in this chapter.

-   Whenever the Opposing Fields program is installed or re-installed a
    number of test plans from the Opposing Fields program should be compared
    to equivalent plans from the primary planning system, for each energy,
    covering a range of field sizes and depths. The monitor units generated
    by each should not differ by more than 2%.

-   If the data in the primary planning system changes for any reason the
    Beam Data file must be regenerated with the new data. Please consult the
    Beam User Manual for generating the Beam file.

-   After every major service or repair on the linac the percentage depth
    dose data should be compared to the values in the appendix. If the data
    has changed significantly new TMR's must be calculated and the beam file
    regenerated.
