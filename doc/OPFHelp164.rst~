Calculation of dose parameters
------------------------------

In addition to the given monitor units a number of other parameters are also
calculated. These can generally be derived from the equations given
previously but for completeness will be given here.


Approximate percentage skin dose calculation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equation 3 from Quality Assurance on Single Beam treatments is used to calculate the
proportion of dose at 1 mm below the skin surface. The result is expressed as
a percentage. Contributions from all beams are considered giving:

.. math::
   :label: eq11

   SK = 100 \cdot \left[ \left(TMR(d,r_{0.1}) \cfrac {SCD}{SSD + 0.1} \right)^2
   + TMR(d,r_{diam}) \cdot \left( \cfrac {SCD}{SSD + diam} \right)^2 \right]


This result should be viewed as an approximation only as the TMR's can be
quite inaccurate near the skin surface.


Percentage tumour dose calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an estimate of the percentage depth dose to the tumour. For a single
field it is:

.. math::
   :label: eq12

   \%DD_{TD} = 100 \cdot TMR(d,r) \left (\cfrac{SCD}{SSD+d} \right )^2

For opposing fields it is:

.. math::
   :label: eq13

   \%DD_{TD} = 200 \cdot TMR(d,r) \left (\cfrac{SCD}{SSD+d} \right )^2



Percentage maximum dose calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a single field the percentage maximum dose **%DD** is the dose at Dmax. For
other SSD's an inverse square correction factor needs to be made giving:

.. math::
   :label: eq14

   \%DD_{d_{max}} = 100 \cdot \left (\cfrac{SCD}{SSD + d_{max}} \right )^2


When parallel opposing fields are used the contribution from the other beam
must be taken into account and equation 4 from Quality assurance on parallel
opposing beam treatments holds, giving:

.. math::
   :label: eq15

   \%DD_{d_{max}} = 100 + 100 \cdot TMR(d,r_{d_{max}})
   \left (\cfrac{SCD}{SSD + diam - d_{max}} \right )^2



Absolute maximum dose calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the dose at dmax. For parallel opposing fields the contribution from
both beams must be taken into account.

.. math::
   :label: eq16

   MD = \cfrac{Dose \cdot \%DD_{D_{max}}}{\%DD_r}

Note that if compensators are used the maximum dose and the reference dose
are adjusted for the attenuation due to the compensator.


Reference dose calculation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference dose is the dose at dmax for one beam. Thus, for single beam
treatments the maximum dose and the reference dose will be the same. For
parallel opposed treatments the reference dose is the dose at dmax for the
given beam without any other contributions. This should correspond to the in-
vivo diode reading assuming the diodes have been calibrated to give a reading
of 100 cGy at 100 cm SSD for a 10x10 cm field.

.. math::
   :label: eq17

   RD = \cfrac{Dose}{\%DD_r}
