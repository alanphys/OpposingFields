Total Dose
~~~~~~~~~~

This is the total dose specified for the patient. It is a numeric field. The
dose is restricted to between 0 and 100 Gy. Should you enter a value outside
these limits, a dialogue box will appear giving you an error message and
warning you that your value should be between 0 and 100 Gy. Press the 'OK'
button to acknowledge the dialogue box and then enter in the correct value
into the 'Total dose' field. You will not be allowed to enter any other data
into any other fields until you have created a correct value for the total
dose. This field is compulsory.
