Exiting the Program
===================

There are three ways to exit the program. You may either use the 'Close'
button on the top right hand corner of the title bar, or you may use the
'File', 'Exit' option on the menu bar, or you may click the 'Exit' button |Exit|
on the speed bar. If the Results window is still open, you will need to close
this first. 

You close the Results window in the same fashion as closing the
Data Entry window, either by clicking the 'Close' button, or by selecting
'File', 'Exit' or by clicking the 'Exit' speed button |Exit|
. If you have data that has not been saved, the program will ask you before
closing whether the data should be saved or not. Click 'Yes' to save the
data; click 'No' to exit without saving the data; and click 'Cancel' to
return to the program again.
