Title Bar
---------

At the top of the Opposing Fields window is the title bar. This tells you
where you are. Currently it should be displaying the name of your centre. It
also contains the icon for the Opposing Fields program on the right hand side
of the title bar and the standard three Windows buttons; 'Minimise',
'Maximise' and 'Close' on the right hand side. Directly underneath the title
bar is the menu bar. This contains the options 'File' and 'Calculate'. You
can either select a menu item by clicking on it with the mouse, or by using
the <ALT> key and the underlined letter. For example, if you want to access
the File menu, press <ALT>-<F> and the 'File' menu will appear. To access one
of the options on this menu, simply press the underlined letter again. For
example, press <O> to open a file.
