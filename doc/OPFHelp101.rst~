Creating a new plan
-------------------

There are two ways of creating a new plan, either click on the 'New patient'
speed button |New|
, or select the 'File', 'New' menu option. When the program is first run the
fields will be greyed, and before you can continue you must either create a
new plan or open an existing plan. Once you have created a new plan the
fields will become white, indicating that you can now enter data.
