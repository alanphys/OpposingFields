Treatment Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a selection field allowing you to choose between opposing fields and
a single field. Remember that opposing fields always means parallel opposing
beams, whereas a single field is just one beam. Again you cannot type
anything in this field; you must choose between opposing and single. You can
either use the mouse, or you can press 'o' for opposing or 's' for single, or
you can use the <down arrow> or <up arrow> keys. Your selection affects the
way the treatment depth is described. For opposing fields the treatment depth
is half the patient diameter. In the case of a single field any treatment
depth can be specified.




When the 'Opposing' option is selected the 'Treatment depth' field is
disabled and you can only enter the patient diameter. Selecting 'Single'
disables the 'Patient diameter' field and enables the 'Treatment depth'
field. The type of treatment field also affects the 'Prescription Type'
field, the 'Presentation' field and the 'Table' field. If the 'Single' beam
option is selected the 'Presentation' field and 'Table' field are disabled as
it is assumed the treatment does not go through the table. The 'Prescription
Type' field defaults to 'Tumour dose' and is disabled as the 'Maximum dose'
prescription applies only to opposing fields.
