SSD
~~~

This is the source to surface distance at the central axis of the beam that
you are treating over. Depending on whether you chose isocentric, fixed SSD
or variable SSD treatment, you may not be able to enter data in this field.
If the 'Isocentric' or 'Fixed SSD' options were chosen this field will be
disabled and you will advance automatically to the next field. If you chose
variable SSD treatment, then you must enter a value into this field. The SSD
should be between 5 and 200 centimetres. If you are using compensators and a
variable SSD please make sure you understand fully how the Opposing Fields
program handles compensators.
