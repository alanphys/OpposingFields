For the Medical Physicist
=========================

The Opposing Fields program uses the system of dosimetric calculations as
laid down by Khan [1] and Johns and Cunningham [2]. The tissue maximum ratios
(TMRs) are calculated by interpolation from tables. Output factors are
calculated from an exponential fit to measured data.
A summary of these methods is given below to aid quality assurance procedures.
