Data errors
-----------

The second set of errors concern the data entered. As stated before, a number
of validation checks are carried out on the data. If you receive a data
error, first of all check your most recently entered value. When you press
the 'Calculate' button or select the 'Calculate' option, another check is
performed on the data as well. In addition to the warning messages you may
receive one of the following errors.





Data Out of Range:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have tried to calculate a plan with data that is invalid. Go back and
scan through your data making sure your values are correct. Be careful of
spaces, characters and punctuation marks in numeric fields.

error, where it occurred and contact technical assistance.

the program and starting it again as a final measure.
